To keep with tradition a separate construction team is not called in, rather the ring announcers are.  The process requires extreme precision and care. The ring must be 4.55 meters in diameter mounted on a clay platform 66 cm tall and 6.7 m wide. The clay is brought from the Arakawa River. Traditional tools are also required, shovels, wooden mallets, hoes, and beer bottles. The beer bottles have a purpose. They are placed inside the rice straw wraps that make up the ring center and the edges of the ring. These are wrapped tightly enough to stand up to 15 days of wrestling.  A central hole is left for the day before the tournament covered next.</p>

High ranking wrestlers, coaches, and referees are all present as well to witness the ceremony. A shrine in the center of the ring signifies 7 godly presences. This whole ceremony of course links back to sumo's ceremonial roots. The three highest ranked referees enter ring side and the ceremony begins. One of the referees enters the ring and blesses it with a branch in the shrine and exits the ring. Next the highest ranked referee enters and says a prayer. Finally the other two referees join the highest ranking referee in the ring and move the altar flags to the four corners of the ring. The two lower ranking referees leave the ring once more leaving the high ranking one to say another prayer. He then pours sake and dumps other items into the hole left in the ring from earlier. The final event is a drum paraded around the ring 3 times while being played. With this the blessing is over.";
